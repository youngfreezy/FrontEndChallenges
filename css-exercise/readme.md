For this exercise you will be building a very simple vertical navigation of
links with icons. There will be a simple hover effect associated with each nav
item. Please take a look at the mock.png and mock-hover.png files included in
this folder to see what you will be building. All the necessary assets to turn
this into working html are included as well.

Your job is to deliver a zipped folder with a working index.html file
containing the working navigation as it was designed in the mocks. Please place
css in a separate folder.

You can structure the html and write the css anyway you see fit. But please
make sure that it functions in IE8+, and the latest Firefox, Safari and Chrome
browsers.
